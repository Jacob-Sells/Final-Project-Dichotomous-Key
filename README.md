My final project is what is known as a "dichotomous key:" a document used in the biology fields to help identify species of organisms. This key will ask a series of yes or no questions to narrow down what species the user is looking at. The key I made is for herpetelogical (reptile and amphibian) species found in and around the state of Florida!
Included with this code will be an asset folder containing images of all the species on this key. While they aren't needed to run the program, they serve as the point of reference for the user. Look at them and answer the questions based on what you see!
During the coding process, I utilized online tutorials to teach me how to use the Node functions in VSCode. I used a few sources that came up from quick Google searches, such as TutorialsPoint and GeeksforGeeks
Below is a demo video to show how it works!
Enjoy utilizing this dichotomous key!
